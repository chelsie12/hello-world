place to store ideas and resources
this could be a **good** place to work through *r code* for the next few manuscripts
##make a h2 tag
try __bold__ and _italics_, can either use astericks or underscoring _especially **nice** if you want to use both_
* lists are unordered
* when astericks are used
* be sure to include a space after the asterisks to make it clear you aren't trying to write in italics
1. for orderd lists
2. used numbers
Now try making a table.
Column 1 Header | Column 2 Header | Three Columns is Crazy
---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------
Cell 1,1 | Cell 1,2 | Cell 1,3
**significant**| *cool* | **_showing off_**
can't get table to work. 
~~but i can cross things out~~
